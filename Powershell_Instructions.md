If you are configuring your own server, continue with the steps below to run the PowerShell script.

## Setup
-----------

First, make sure you have <a href="SetupSQL.html">set up your SQL Server</a>.  Then proceed with the steps below to run the solution template using the automated PowerShell files. 

## Execute PowerShell Script
----------------------------

Running this PowerShell script will create stored procedures for the the operationalization of this solution.  It will also execute these procedures to create full database with results of the steps  â€“ dataset creation, modeling, and scoring as described in the [For the Database Analyst](dba.html) page.



1.	Click on the windows key on your keyboard. Type the words `PowerShell`.  Right click on Windows Powershell to and select `Run as administrator` to open the PowerShell window.


2.	In the Powershell command window, type the following command:
  
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
    ```

    Answer `y` to the prompt to allow the following scripts to execute.

3. Create a directory on your computer where you will put this solution.  CD to the directory and then clone the repository into it:
    
    ```
    git clone {{ site.code_url }} {{ site.folder_name }}
    ```

4.  CD to the **{{ site.folder_name }}/SQLR** directory.

5. You are now ready to run the PowerShell script.  

    * Use  the following command, inserting your server name, database name, username, and password.
    
        ```
        .\{{ site.ps1_name }} -ServerName "Server Name" -DBName "Database Name" -username "" -password "" 
        ```

    * For example, for a user named <code>rdemo</code> with a password of <code>D@tascience</code> on his local computer, the command would be: 

        ```
        .\{{ site.ps1_name }} -ServerName "localhost" -DBName "{{ site.db_name }}" -username "rdemo" -password "D@tascience" 
        ```


## Review Data
--------------

Once the PowerShell script has completed successfully, log into the SQL Server Management Studio to view all the datasets that have been created in the `{{ site.db_name }}` and the `{{ site.db_name }}_Prod` databases.  
Hit `Refresh` if necessary.
<br/>

* View [more information](tables.html)  about each of the tables created in the `{{ site.db_name }}` database.

* Right click on `{{ site.db_name }}.dbo.Predict_Scores` and select `View Top 1000 Rows` to preview the testing scored data.

* Right click on `{{ site.db_name }}_Prod.dbo.Prod_Scores` and select `View Top 1000 Rows` to preview the production scored data.


## Visualizing Results 
---------------------

You've now  uploaded and processed transaction data, created models and evaluated the model  as described  [here](data-scientist.html). 

Let's look at our current results. Proceed to <a href="Visualize_Results.html">Visualizing Results with PowerBI</a>.

## Other Steps
----------------

You've just completed the fully automated solution by executing PowerShell scripts.  

See the [Typical Workflow](Typical.html) for a description of how these files were first created in R by a Data Scientist and then incorporated into the SQL stored procedures that you just deployed.
